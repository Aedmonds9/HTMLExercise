      Over the course of a decade as a medical courier, I've gained valuable experience in timely and secure transport of medical specimens and supplies. I've honed organizational skills, navigated logistical challenges, and upheld strict confidentiality standards. Interacting with healthcare professionals, I've developed strong communication and customer service abilities. This experience has reinforced my sense of responsibility and accountability in supporting patient care.
